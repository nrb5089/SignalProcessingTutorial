    "Python is a relatively easy programming language that we use for signal processing demonstration and prototyping of algorithms.  The key mathematics come from operations in linear algebra and concepts in statistics/probability.  We use the analogy of 1D and 2D arrays to correspond to vectors and matrices, respectively.  The following tutorial provides some basic arithmetic and implementation syntax, along with the mathematical equivalent statements.  \n",

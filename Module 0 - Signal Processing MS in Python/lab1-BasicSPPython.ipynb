    "## Why all the emphasis on arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are a fundamental part of handling and manipulating signals and images in computational and data science contexts. Both **digital** signals and images can be represented as arrays of numerical data (**analog** can only be approximated), which can then be processed and analyzed using a variety of techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signals**: Signals, such as audio signals, can be represented as one-dimensional arrays. In this context, each element in the array represents the amplitude of the signal at a given point in time. The sequence of these amplitudes over time forms the audio signal. This representation allows for digital signal processing techniques to be applied, such as filtering, Fourier transformation, or any other form of signal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Images**: Images can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays (typically two or three dimensions). In a grayscale image, a two-dimensional array can be used where each element represents the intensity of a pixel in the image. For color images, usually a three-dimensional array is used. The first two dimensions represent the x and y coordinates of a pixel, and the third dimension represents the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels. Each element in this array is again a numerical value representing the intensity of the corresponding color channel at a given pixel, i.e. an 8-bit grayscale image would be a 2D array of values ranging 0-255 ($2^8-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "By representing signals and images as arrays, powerful mathematical and computational operations can be applied to them. This includes convolution for image filtering, Fourier transforms for frequency analysis of signals, or linear algebra operations for image transformations. It also opens the possibility for machine learning algorithms to learn from these arrays of data, which has led to advances in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and more.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python that allows users to create a wide range of high-quality plots, charts, and graphs. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  With Matplotlib, users can generate line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and many other types of visual representations. It offers precise control over every aspect of a plot, including the axes, labels, colors, markers, and styles, allowing users to customize their visualizations to suit their needs.  Matplotlib is widely used in various fields such as data analysis, scientific research, engineering, finance, and more. It integrates well with other libraries and frameworks in the Python ecosystem, making it a versatile tool for data exploration and presentation.  In addition to its core functionality, Matplotlib also provides support for creating interactive plots using widgets and event handling, saving plots in different file formats, and incorporating mathematical expressions and LaTeX typesetting.\n",

    "**Time Domain:** The time domain is a representation of a signal (like the music from the orchestra) that shows how the signal changes over time. When you plot the signal in the time domain, you can see the amplitude (how loud the orchestra is playing) at each point in time. However, in this representation, it's very hard to distinguish between the sounds made by different instruments. \n",

When you put on these glasses while listening to the orchestra, instead of hearing all the sounds mixed together, you start to hear each instrument separately. The violin, the trumpet, the drums, all become individually distinguishable. This is similar to a signal in the frequency (or spectral) domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequency (Spectral) Domain:** The frequency domain is a representation of a signal that shows the different frequencies (like the individual notes played by different instruments) that make up the overall signal. When you plot the signal in the frequency domain, you can see the amplitude (how loud each instrument is playing) for each frequency (each instrument's note). This representation is very useful when you want to analyze the signal in terms of its constituent frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Photographs (Lower Rate):** You snap a few photos occasionally — maybe one every few minutes. This is analogous to \"down-sampling\" or \"decimation\" in multi-rate signal processing. You're capturing fewer frames over a certain period, thereby reducing the \"data rate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Videos (Higher Rate):** Now, when there's a crucial play, you switch to recording a video at 60 frames per second. Here, you're capturing a lot of frames in a short amount of time. This is similar to \"up-sampling\" or \"interpolation,\" where you increase the data rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of digital signal processing, \"sampling\" is like taking these photos or videos. It's how we convert real-world signals (like sound or radio waves) into digital data that computers and electronics can understand.  Just like in our sports game scenario, sometimes we want to process some parts of a signal at a higher \"frame rate\" (or data rate) because there's more happening there.

    "Imagine you are looking at a connect-the-dots puzzle, but some of the dots are missing. You can still visualize the shape or picture by drawing straight lines between the dots you can see, even if there are gaps.  Interpolation is like filling in those missing dots so that the picture is more complete and flows smoothly. Instead of having jagged straight lines, you can get a curve or a smoother line that makes more sense and provides a better idea of the whole picture.  For a simpler example, think about the temperature readings at noon over a week. If you only have readings for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but you want to guess (or estimate) what the temperature was on Tuesday and Thursday, you could use the readings from the days you know to make a good guess. Interpolation is the mathematical way of making that guess.  In essence, interpolation is about using what you know to estimate what you don't know. It helps in filling gaps or making smoother transitions between known points or values."

    "\n",
    "The ```lfilter``` function applies the convolution in the time domain, which is colloquially known as linear filtering, but is actually inefficient compared to other methods.  In this problem we set up a demonstration that you will fill in the blanks for FFT convolution.  Both vectors being convolved must be zero padded to have the same length, the FFT of each vector is then multiplied together, and then we take the IFFT. Fill in the ```?``` below."

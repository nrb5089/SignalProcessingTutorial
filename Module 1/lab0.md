# Introduction to Software Defined Radio (SDR) (or Software Controlled Radio)

Software Defined Radio (SDR) is like a radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware (like mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.

To understand this, let's consider an analogy.

Think about how you might adjust the settings on your TV or your music system. Normally, you would push a button or turn a dial. Now, imagine if you could do that with a software on your computer or phone. You could change the volume, switch channels, adjust the brightness, etc., and all of this without ever touching the TV or music system.

That's a bit like what software-defined radio does. The "settings" of the radio--like which frequency to tune into--are controlled by software. This means you can use the same piece of hardware to listen to FM radio, shortwave, Wi-Fi signals, etc., just by changing the software.

The beauty of SDRs is their flexibility. With the right software, an SDR can become virtually any radio device you need. This makes them useful in many areas of technology and communication.

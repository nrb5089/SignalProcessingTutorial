    "In-phase Quadrature (IQ) signals are used extensively in signal processing and telecommunications. IQ representation of a signal is essential for the modulation and demodulation processes in communication systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand IQ signals, let's start with an introduction to basic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseband signal**: A signal with frequency components that are close to zero (around DC). It's the original frequency band of a signal before it's modulated for transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passband signal**: A signal that has been modulated to a higher frequency band for transmission. It's called a passband signal because it's within the frequency band, or \"passband,\" of the transmission channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-phase component (I component)**: This is the real part of a signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quadrature component (Q component)**: This is the imaginary part of a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseband IQ Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the baseband IQ representation, a signal is represented by its I and Q components. The I component is the projection of the signal onto the real (or X) axis, and the Q component is the projection onto the imaginary (or Y) axis. You can think of an IQ signal as a 2D vector in this I-Q plane, with the I component representing the magnitude of the signal on the x-axis and the Q component representing the magnitude of the signal on the y-axis.\n",

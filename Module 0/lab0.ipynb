    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a relatively easy programming language that we use for signal processing demonstration and prototyping of algorithms.  The key mathematics come from operations in linear algebra and concepts in statistics/probability.  We use the analogy of 1D and 2D arrays to correspond to vectors and matrices, respectively.  Ideally, we would do most of our low-level signal processing at the hardware level either via ASICs or FPGAs.   The following tutorial provides some basic arithmetic and implementation syntax, along with the mathematical equivalent statements.  \n",

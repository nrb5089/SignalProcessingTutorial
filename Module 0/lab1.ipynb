    "## Why all the emphasis on arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are a fundamental part of handling and manipulating signals and images in computational and data science contexts. Both **digital** signals and images can be represented as arrays of numerical data (**analog** can only be approximated), which can then be processed and analyzed using a variety of techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signals**: Signals, such as audio signals, can be represented as one-dimensional arrays. In this context, each element in the array represents the amplitude of the signal at a given point in time. The sequence of these amplitudes over time forms the audio signal. This representation allows for digital signal processing techniques to be applied, such as filtering, Fourier transformation, or any other form of signal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Images**: Images can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays (typically two or three dimensions). In a grayscale image, a two-dimensional array can be used where each element represents the intensity of a pixel in the image. For color images, usually a three-dimensional array is used. The first two dimensions represent the x and y coordinates of a pixel, and the third dimension represents the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels. Each element in this array is again a numerical value representing the intensity of the corresponding color channel at a given pixel, i.e. an 8-bit grayscale image would be a 2D array of values ranging 0-255 ($2^8-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "By representing signals and images as arrays, powerful mathematical and computational operations can be applied to them. This includes convolution for image filtering, Fourier transforms for frequency analysis of signals, or linear algebra operations for image transformations. It also opens the possibility for machine learning algorithms to learn from these arrays of data, which has led to advances in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and more.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python that allows users to create a wide range of high-quality plots, charts, and graphs. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  With Matplotlib, users can generate line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and many other types of visual representations. It offers precise control over every aspect of a plot, including the axes, labels, colors, markers, and styles, allowing users to customize their visualizations to suit their needs.  Matplotlib is widely used in various fields such as data analysis, scientific research, engineering, finance, and more. It integrates well with other libraries and frameworks in the Python ecosystem, making it a versatile tool for data exploration and presentation.  In addition to its core functionality, Matplotlib also provides support for creating interactive plots using widgets and event handling, saving plots in different file formats, and incorporating mathematical expressions and LaTeX typesetting.\n",

    "# Spectral Domain vs. Time Domain and a better waveform model\n",
    "Let's start with an analogy. Imagine you are listening to a symphony orchestra playing a piece of music. All the different instruments playing together create a rich, complex sound that changes over time. This is similar to a signal in the time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Domain:** The time domain is a representation of a signal (like the music from the orchestra) that shows how the signal changes over time. When you plot the signal in the time domain, you can see the amplitude (how loud the orchestra is playing) at each point in time. However, in this representation, it's very hard to distinguish between the sounds made by different instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you have a magical pair of glasses. When you put on these glasses while listening to the orchestra, instead of hearing all the sounds mixed together, you start to hear each instrument separately. The violin, the trumpet, the drums, all become individually distinguishable. This is similar to a signal in the frequency (or spectral) domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequency (Spectral) Domain:** The frequency domain is a representation of a signal that shows the different frequencies (like the individual notes played by different instruments) that make up the overall signal. When you plot the signal in the frequency domain, you can see the amplitude (how loud each instrument is playing) for each frequency (each instrument's note). This representation is very useful when you want to analyze the signal in terms of its constituent frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time domain representation of a signal shows how the signal changes over time. \n",
    "- The frequency domain representation of a signal shows the constituent frequencies of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In signal processing, we often convert signals from the time domain to the frequency domain (and vice versa) because certain types of analysis and processing are easier to perform in the frequency domain. This transformation is typically done using a mathematical technique called the Fourier transform.\n",

    "## 3. Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourier transform is a way to transform a signal from time domain to frequency domain (roughly speaking). We can use the `np.fft.fft` function to compute the one-dimensional n-point discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).  We use ```np.abs``` to compute the absolute value of each element in the array to get what is called the magnitude response of the spectrum:"
